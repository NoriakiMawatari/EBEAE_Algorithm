# EBEAE  Algorithm
## Extended Blind Endmember and Abundance Extraction (EBEAE) Algorithm for multi/hyperspectral imaging analysis.
This repository contains necessary files for synthetic evaluation of EBEAE with multispectral 
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (mFLIM) and Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) datasets.

### EXECUTION
- This script is meant to be executed from the terminal (default input arguments):
    - ``python3 ebeae_synthetic_ds.py``
  
**NOTE: mflim_parameters and vnir_parameters dictionaries 
can be edited in ebeae_synyhetic_ds.py.**

### OUTPUTS
Printed results of implementation in terminal and two .png files that will be autosaved in the current directory 
containing abundance maps and the endmembers plotted respectively.

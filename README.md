# EBEAE  Algorithm
## Extended Blind Endmember and Abundance Extraction (EBEAE) Algorithm for multi/hyperspectral imaging analysis.

This repository contains the necessary files for synthetic evaluation of EBEAE with multispectral 
Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (mFLIM) and Visible-Near Infrared (VNIR) datasets.

E X E C U T I O N:
- By terminal (default input arguments):
    - python3 EBEAE_2.0.py

- By IDE:
    - Allows edition of the input arguments to work with EBEAE algorithm.

O U T P U T S:

Printed results of implementation in terminal and two .png files that will be autosaved in the current directory 
containing abundance maps and the endmembers plotted respectively.
